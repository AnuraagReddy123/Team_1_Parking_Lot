Parking Lot

We used object oriented thinking to create a virtual system which will be used in a parking lot to implement all the functions such as showing available space for specific type of vehicle, maintaining a record of all the entries, etc. 

Input is taken from the user to know whether the user is a customer or owner. The owner of the parking lot can then get information about the profit made till now, total vehicles parked till now, currently parked vehicles and all entries till now. 

If it is a customer who is entering the parking lot, all the available spots across the five floors of the parking lot will be displayed according to the type of the vehicle (Large, Compact, Bike, Handicap) and electric or non-electric which will be taken as an input from the customer. The customerâ€™s name and the duration for which the customer is going to stay in the parking lot is also taken as an input. A new challan number will be issued to each customer every time they enter the lot. Customers can also charge their electric vehicle during the time with an additional amount.

A customer leaving the parking lot will be asked to pay to the attendant or pay through the automated floor exit. Customers can make a payment via the Customer Info Portal also. The amount will be calculated and displayed after a customer gives their challan number which was issued earlier as an input. Customers have the option to pay through cash or card. After paying customer can leave the lot.
